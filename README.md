# NXP-mbed-LPC1768-Projects
This repository contains a series of embedded projects built using the NXP mbed LPC1768 development board. Each project demonstrates different aspects of embedded programming â€” including GPIO control, sensor interfacing, communication protocols (UART, I2C, SPI), PWM control, and real-time data processing. Designed for learning and experimentation, these examples are ideal for students and developers exploring ARM Cortex-M3 based microcontrollers and the mbed OS environment.
