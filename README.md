# LCD Display with Ultrasonic Sensor using NXP mbed LPC1768

## 🔧 Components Used
- NXP mbed LPC1768 Development Board  
- 16x2 LCD Display  
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)  
- LED  
- Buzzer  

## 🧠 Project Overview
This project measures distance using an ultrasonic sensor and displays the result on a 16x2 LCD.  
If the measured distance falls below a threshold, an LED and buzzer are activated as a warning indicator.

## ⚙️ Features
- Real-time distance measurement  
- Visual alert on LCD display  
- Audible and LED alerts for nearby objects  
- Demonstrates interfacing of peripherals with LPC1768 using mbed APIs

## 🧩 Code Highlights
- Utilizes `DigitalOut`, `AnalogIn`, and `Timer` classes from mbed library  
- Displays data using standard 4-bit LCD communication  
- Simple threshold-based alert logic
